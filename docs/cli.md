### Mist command-line interface


Mist CLI is a simple command-line interface to the Mist service.


This is where cli comes into play, cli makes mist job managing organized and easy!


Usage:

```
Run single Mist job:
./mist start job
     --config <path>                 path to Mist config
     --jar <path>                    path to Mist compiled jar
     --path <path>                   path to Mist Job
     --classname <class name>        Mist job class name
     --external-id <id>              some id for external separation of jobs
     --namespace <namespace>         Mist namespace
     --route <route>                 Mist route (see https://github.com/Hydrospheredata/mist/blob/master/docs/routes.md)
     --parameters <json>             parameters for Mist job in JSON format

Manage job and workers:
./mist start cli

    --list workers                   list all started workers
    --list jobs                      list all started jobs
    --kill all                       kill all workers
    --kill worker <namespace>        kill named worker
    --kill job <external id>         kill named job
```


You can easily run CLI and this will give mist command-line interface.
